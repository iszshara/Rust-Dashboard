//! Documentation for the SystemInfo Trait and its Implementation
///
/// ''' pub trait SystemInfo '''  
/// What it is:  
/// This is a trait. In Rust, traits define a set of behaviors (methods) that a type can implement.  
/// Here, it is defined that any type that implements SystemInfo must have a get_cpus method  
/// (which returns a list of cpu_info::Cpu objects) and a global_cpu_usage method (which returns the global CPU usage).  
///
/// ''' impl SystemInfo for System '''  
/// What it is: This is the implementation of the SystemInfo trait for the concrete sysinfo::System struct.  
/// It defines how a real sysinfo::System instance executes the methods of the SystemInfo trait.  
/// It converts the sysinfo::Cpu objects into cpu_info::Cpu objects.  
///
/// Why it was created: This is the core of testability. Instead of making the functions directly  
/// dependent on sysinfo::System, they are made dependent on any type that implements the SystemInfo  
/// trait (sys: &impl SystemInfo).  
/// This is called Dependency Injection.  
/// In production code, sysinfo::System is used, but in test code, the mock implementation is used.

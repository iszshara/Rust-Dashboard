//! Why cpu_info.rs exists:
/// What it is: This is a simple struct called Cpu. It represents the basic
/// information about a CPU that our application needs:
/// the usage and the brand name of the CPU.
/// Why it's needed: You can't directly access sysinfo::Cpu because it's a
/// complex structure that is not easy to create or manipulate for testing.
/// By defining our own Cpu structure, we decouple the application from the internal details of
/// the sysinfo crate.
/// This makes the code more flexible and, above all, testable.

#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct Cpu {
    pub usage: f32,
    pub brand: String,
}
